# ADR Go
A minimalist command line tool written in Go to work with [Architecture Decision Records](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) (ADRs).

Greatly inspired by the [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) with all of the added benefits of using the Go instead of Bash.
